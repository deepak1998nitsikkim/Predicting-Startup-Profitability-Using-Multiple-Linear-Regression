# Startup-Dataset-Prediction-Using-Linear-Regression
This project focuses on predicting outcomes for startups using linear regression technique. It involves data analysis, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation to derive insights and accurate predictions.

1. Data Loading and Exploration:
    Loading a dataset that includes features related to startup success.
    Performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand key patterns and insights.

2. Data Preprocessing:
    Cleaning and transforming data to prepare it for our model.
    Handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and scaling numerical features.

3. Model Development:
    Building our model to predict startup outcomes.
    Implementing linear regression technique based on the target variable.

4. Model Evaluation:
    Assessing model performance using metrics such as r2_score, MSE.

5. Insights and Conclusions:
    Visualizing results and discussing key findings.
    Highlighting actionable insights for startups based on model predictions.

Features
    Utilizes Python libraries like NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, and matplotlib for analysis and visualization.
