This Python code is a comprehensive implementation of a predictive model to estimate the profitability of startups based on their expenditures and operational factors. It demonstrates the application of machine learning in solving real-world business problems, emphasizing exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and model evaluation.

# Step 1: Importing Libraries
The necessary Python libraries are imported for various tasks such as data manipulation, visualization, preprocessing, and machine learning:

import numpy as np

import pandas as pd
from numpy import math
from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.metrics import r2_score, mean_squared_error
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

numpy: For numerical computations.
pandas: For loading and manipulating data.
matplotlib.pyplot: For creating visualizations.
scikit-learn: For preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

# Step 2: Loading the Dataset
The dataset, 50_Startups.csv, is loaded, and its structure is explored.

dataset = pd.read_csv('50_Startups.csv')
len(dataset)
dataset.head()
dataset.shape
len(dataset): Shows the total number of rows in the dataset.
dataset.head(): Displays the first five rows for a quick overview.
dataset.shape: Returns the number of rows and columns.

# Step 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

# Scatter Plots
Scatter plots are created to analyze the relationship between independent variables and the dependent variable (Profit).

plt.scatter(dataset['Marketing Spend'], dataset['Profit'], alpha=0.5)
plt.title('Scatter plot of Profit with Marketing Spend')
plt.xlabel('Marketing Spend')
plt.ylabel('Profit')
plt.show()

plt.scatter(dataset['R&D Spend'], dataset['Profit'], alpha=0.5)
plt.title('Scatter plot of Profit with R&D Spend')
plt.xlabel('R&D Spend')
plt.ylabel('Profit')
plt.show()

plt.scatter(dataset['Administration'], dataset['Profit'], alpha=0.5)
plt.title('Scatter plot of Profit with Administration')
plt.xlabel('Administration')
plt.ylabel('Profit')
plt.show()
These visualizations help identify which features are most correlated with profit.

# Bar Plot
The average profit across different states is visualized using a bar plot.

ax = dataset.groupby(['State'])['Profit'].mean().plot.bar(
    figsize=(10, 5),
    fontsize=14
)
ax.set_title("Average profit for different states where the startups operate", fontsize=20)
ax.set_xlabel("State", fontsize=15)
ax.set_ylabel("Profit", fontsize=15)

# Step 4: Data Preprocessing
The categorical variable State is converted into dummy variables.

dataset['NewYork_State'] = np.where(dataset['State'] == 'New York', 1, 0)
dataset['California_State'] = np.where(dataset['State'] == 'California', 1, 0)
dataset['Florida_State'] = np.where(dataset['State'] == 'Florida', 1, 0)
dataset.drop(columns=['State'], axis=1, inplace=True)
np.where: Creates binary dummy variables for each state.
drop: Removes the original State column.

# Step 5: Defining Independent and Dependent Variables
The independent variables (X) and dependent variable (y) are defined.

dependent_variable = 'Profit'
independent_variables = list(set(dataset.columns.tolist()) - {dependent_variable})
X = dataset[independent_variables].values
y = dataset[dependent_variable].values
independent_variables: A dynamic way to exclude the dependent variable (Profit) from the dataset.
X and y: Arrays of independent and dependent variables, respectively.

# Step 6: Splitting the Dataset
The data is split into training and test sets.

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=0)

test_size=0.2: 20% of the data is allocated for testing.
random_state=0: Ensures reproducibility

# Step 7: Feature Scaling
Feature scaling is applied to normalize the independent variables.

scaler = MinMaxScaler()
X_train = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test = scaler.transform(X_test)
MinMaxScaler: Scales features to a range of 0 to 1.

# Step 8: Training the Model
A Multiple Linear Regression model is trained using the training data.

regressor = LinearRegression()
regressor.fit(X_train, y_train)
fit: Learns the relationship between X_train and y_train.

# Step 9: Model Coefficients
The coefficients and intercept of the regression model are retrieved.

regressor.intercept_
regressor.coef_
These values indicate the impact of each feature on the target variable (Profit).

# Step 10: Predicting Results
The model predicts profits for both the training and test datasets.

y_pred_train = regressor.predict(X_train)
y_pred = regressor.predict(X_test)

# Step 11: Model Evaluation
The model is evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R² Score.

mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
math.sqrt(mean_squared_error(y_train, y_pred_train))
math.sqrt(mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred))
r2_score(y_train, y_pred_train)
r2_score(y_test, y_pred)
MSE: Measures average squared error.
RMSE: Provides a more interpretable metric.
R² Score: Indicates the proportion of variance explained by the model.

# Key Insights
Features like R&D Spend and Marketing Spend significantly impact profitability.
The model achieves a high R² score, indicating good explanatory power.
Normalization and feature selection improve the model's reliability and accuracy.
